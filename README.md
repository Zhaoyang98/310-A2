# Interactive psychiatrist chat agent

An interactive psychiatrist chat agent implemented in python. The agent utilizes a parser combinator to parse English syntax and determine the structure of sentences and keywords. This is used to identified what type of sentence the user has provided (*ie.* whether it's a question or statement) and the tone of sentence.

### Features

- Interactive conversation
- Sentence grammar parsing
- Understanding mood
- Providing help to user

## Usage

Requires python 3.8

```bash
# Use virtual envirornment
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

### Test

```bash
python3 -m unittest test
```



## Modules

- `agent.py`: Primary entry point for running the agent, reads input from user and writes to `stdout`
- `_types.py`: Defines basic types used throughout the source code
- `pcomb.py`: Implementation of a parser combinator, a collection of parsers that convert a stream of characters into tokens.
- `english.py`: Defines grammar for common sentence structures and uses parsers defined in `pcomb.py` to interpret English text.
- `state.py`: Evaluates sentence structure and words generated by english.py to determine how the agent should respond by building a new sentence from dictionaries of keywords.
- `fuzzy.py`: Fuzzy string matching based on leveinshtein distance algorithm.
- `synonyms`: Keyword enlarger based on nltk natural language processing toolkit.
